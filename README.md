## Personal Achievements
Over the summer I took Spanish two so I woudnt have to take it during the year. And I took it for a month. I thought this was a big achievment because for the first two weeks I didnt do any work at all but I managed to catch up and ended the class with a 95%. Another achievment I did was getting betetr at swimming. At the beging of summer I didnt know how to swim. So I decided to take swimmimg lessons a few times a week and I went to my aunts pool a few times. And I plan to take more swimming lessons in the future to get better. Right now I know how to swim but Im still not good at it. 
## Favorite Summer Foods
Before summer I didnt really like drinking tea to much but I slowly liked drinking tea because I went to Victoria Canada and they had tea time there. And I liked it. So now I bought a tea pot and drink tea about every other day with honey. 
## - Expectations for This Class
Last year I didn' really pay attention or do well in this class. Which is why this year I want to pay alot more attention and ask when I need help. Last year on the AP test I got a three. And about a B In the class. This year I want to get atleast a 89% In the class and atleast a 4 on the AP test. 
##  Fun Fact About Yourself
When I was about 5 and six I broke the same arm twice in one year. The first time I broke my arm I was running and fell really hard on the sidewalk. And the second time I was siting on like a window and fell out and fell on my arm.
